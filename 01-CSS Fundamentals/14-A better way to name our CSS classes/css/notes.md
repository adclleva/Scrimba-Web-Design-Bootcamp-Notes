Did you notice that we're repeating ourselves a lot with out button styles?

 We can use multiple classes instead of one
 
 We can accomplish that by creating a "generic" button class for this case
 
 we can separate the classes with a space like this for example <a class="btn btn-accent ...
 
 In our HTML, if we put a space in our class attribute (or ID), you are giving it multiple classes
 
 This is not the same as adding a space in CSS, which is compound selector!
