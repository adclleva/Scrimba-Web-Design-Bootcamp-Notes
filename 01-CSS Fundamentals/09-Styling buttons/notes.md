Put the class directly on your link

Always use padding to create the "size" of the button, and not width and height

It's important to add the class for the interactive element on the element itself and not the div it controls

The padding left and right needs to be a bigger number than the padding on the top and bottom

In general, I use a 1:2.5 ratio for the top and sides, but it really depends on the button, so don't lock yourself in.
