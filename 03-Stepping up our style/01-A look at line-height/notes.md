the line height property has for text to me more leagible 

it's good practice to not have the value be 2 as it will look double spaced

For the body, generally it's a good rule to have it around 1.6 or 1.7 and it depeneds on the font size

We usually want it to be unitless since it is a inherited property

1.4 is the default for the browser
