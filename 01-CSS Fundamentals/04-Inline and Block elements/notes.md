Block level elements will create a new line of content, stacking on top of each other by default
- Paragraphs
- Headings
- lists and list items
- div
- header 
- footer 
- main
- section
- etc.

Inline elements stay within the flow of what's around them.
- Links
- Strong
- em
- span
- Images (sort of)

Important things to know about inline elements:
 - You can only nest other inline elements in them (such as putting a link inside a strong element)
 - They will only respect margin, padding, and borders which are placed on the left or the right side, and not the top and the bottom.
