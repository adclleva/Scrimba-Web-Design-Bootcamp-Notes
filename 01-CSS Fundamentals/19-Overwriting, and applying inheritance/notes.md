You've propbably noticed that links don't inherit their parent's color, even though other inline elements em and strong do.

It's because they alread yhave a default style on them, setting their color to blue, with a text-decoration giving them the underline.

They do inherit other properties such as font-size and font-weight

Also headings do not inherit the font-weight, because they are bold by default 

But you can overwirte this if you want

we can use inherit as a valid value from the parent
