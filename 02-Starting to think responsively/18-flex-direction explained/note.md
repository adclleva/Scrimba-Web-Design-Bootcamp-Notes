The purpose of having the flex-directions is that you are switching the main axis

 The reason is that if you have a flex-direction with the justify-content to be space-between
 You then can have the properties when the contents are in columns

 Justify content works on the main axis 

 Thus is you switch the direction, jsutify-content will work vertically
 While align0items will work horizontally
