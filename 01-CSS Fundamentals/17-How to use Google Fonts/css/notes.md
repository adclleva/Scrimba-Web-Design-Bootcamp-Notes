Try to not choose too much font styles that you want 

When choosing a font front Google Fonts, it's a good idea to choose one that has mutliple styles 
becuase it would give you more customizability.

Once you got the links, make sure you link the font before the stylesheet because you want to make sure you get the font's before accessing the css

We aksi beed to tell it what weights and styles we want to be using, or bold and italic might not work! And this is from the customize section in the Google Fonts

Keep in mind that the fonts would have to be downloaded and it can be slow and fonts can shift (FOUT)
We want to avoid Flash of invisible text (FOIT) and Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT)

This is why we want to choose only what we want since fonts are what slows down sights the most

Also keep in mind that there are other options
