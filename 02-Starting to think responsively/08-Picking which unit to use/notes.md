Pixels used to cause a lot of problems,  as they were a fixed unit (one dot on the screen).

Not it follows the reference pixel

That also makese my answer a little less concrete that I used to have.

But there are advantages to using rem and em.

General rule of thumb(not hard and fast rules):

- Font-size = rem // this prevents the cascading undesired affect from occuring
- Padding and margin = em
- Widths = em or percentage
