Navigations are traditionally marked up using an unordered list, which is placed
inside a <nav> element.

Most navigations are set up within a <ul><li>Content</li></ul> format 
This is also good for accessibility reasons as well

Another thing to notes is that we used a p tag for the subtitle because we usually
use the other h tags for titles for different sections of the page
