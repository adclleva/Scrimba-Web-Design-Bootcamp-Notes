CSS unites come in a few different flavors: 
- Absolute units
- Relavite units
- Percentage
  
Absolute units are the easiest to understand.

- Pixels (px)
- pt, cm, mm, in, etc.

Percentages are mainly used for widths, and are pretty easy to understand.

- Relative to their parent (except on height, where things get weird).

There are two types of relative units.

- Relative to font-size
- Relative to the viewport

Even though it sounds complicated, once you play around with them a little it isn't too bad!

- Relative to font-size:
  - em and rem (and many other less common ones)
- Relative to the viewport (we'll get to this later)
  - vw, vh, vmin, vmax
